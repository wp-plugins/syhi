Plugin Name: SyHi
Version: 0.0.2
Plugin URI: http://soledadpenades.com/projects/wordpress/syhi
Author: Soledad PenadÃ©s
Author URI: http://soledadpenades.com
Description: Minimalistic Syntax Highlighter plug-in which also makes sure code can still be copied and pasted into your favourite compiler!

This plug-in is totally designed for developers.

You know, that sort of people who post code snippets in their blog regularly and hardly use the Visual Editor,
because they write the HTML themselves. But they don't like WordPress messing with their quotes and dashes,
so this plug-in makes sure no one touches one of their lovingly crafted lines of code.

It's also very minimalistic - less than 10k, not counting the GeSHi library which is also [partially] included.

In addition, it's also lazy. It will try to avoid doing as much work as possible.
That is good, because it will not eat resources like other plug-ins out there.

Please have a look at the included readme.txt file for more details on features, usage, etc.
